Version: 0.0.1
Author: [Bardez](https://github.com/BardezAnAvatar)
Bugs reports to [repository's GitHub Issues](https://github.com/BardezAnAvatar/BGEE-Thalantyr-Ex/issues)

## Introduction
This mod is a collection of items that I want to expand or enhance using the Thalantyr Item Upgrade Mod.

## Remarks
I am using the `BZ` prefix for my items, as I have not seen it used or referenced prior.

## Items
### Shandalar's Cloak
I wanted to use the lore from Shandalar and source books, and I thought that inthe off chance that a PC manages to defeat Shandalar, it would be a fun reward to give the player a cloak that they can use that looks and behaves kind of like Shandalar. For References to Shandalar, see: [Shandalar on the Forgottem Realms wiki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shandalar). Note: Shandalar has two publications according to the wiki: Baldur's Gate and [Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Volo%27s_Guide_to_the_Sword_Coast).

**Cost:** consumes shandalar's cloak and wardstone; requires 3 protection scrolls from electricity, 2 protection scrolls from fire, and 10,000 gp.


Cloak will be a + 2 protection cloak (+2 AC, +2 saving throws) which also grants 50% electrical resistance and 25% fire resistance.

### Varscona +3
Varscona is a _very_ decent sword in BG, probably _the_ capstone longsword for base BG1. That said, swords especially into SoD need to go into the +3 realm, and I want to allow the PC to take this beauty all the way to ToB. I'll have more mods for item import later.

**Cost:** Upgrades the +2 longsword to +3; requires 1 emerald, 1 cone of cold scroll, 1 lightning bolt scroll, and 5,000 gp.

Varscona +3 deals 1d8+3 slashing, 2d3 cold; with a +3 enchantment and thac0 bonus. It grants % fire resistance and offers a % chance to drain 1 HP on hit.


### Koveras' Ring of Protection
Ever since I "authored" the BGT mod, I felt this pull towards Koveras' ring of protection. It felt like an item that should have a story to itself, not just a basic clone of a +1 Ring of Protection. It felt like an item that you should be able to keep as a trophy, a momento or other and I always felt it was bogus that this never had anything done with it, but the _golden pantaloons_ were. After checking Github for this item in the BGT repo (not there), and my HDDs from 20-ish years ago, I wanted to put it back in.

This component has two sub-components; both will replace the Ring of Princes flavor text with a description matching in-game events. One will 
have Koveras offer you a cursed ring, the other will leave the interaction as-is. Both paths will have an upgrade to the +2 ring of protection.

#### Component: Koveras' Cursed Ring
Fairly simple: turn the ring Koveras gives you into a cursed ring. It makes sense from a story and RP perspective. If you then un-curse it, it becomes the regular ring of protection.

#### Component: No Cursed Ring
Also fairly simple: the ring that Koveras gives you is not cursed, and can be upgraded straight to a +2 version, with its own flavor text. This component will update the flavor text to deviate from ring of the prices to reflect its history in-game.

### Amulet of Protection +2
Similar to the merging of two rings of protection, this will take two amulets of protection and merge them into a +2 amulet.

**Cost**
The amulet will require two amulets of protection +1 (or an amulet and a ring of protection); two moonbar gems; a diamond; plus 5,000 gold.

### Golden Axe +2
