@700 = ~Ankheg Plate Mail +1~
@701 = ~Ankheg Plate Mail +1

This plate mail has been expertly crafted by Taerom Fuiruim of Beregost. Sheathed in the chitinous scales of the ankheg, it provides a greater degree of protection than traditional plate mail and is not susceptible to rust. As any world-weary adventurer will tell you, however, the best appreciated aspect of ankheg mail is its light weight and low encumbrance. Monsters come and go, but fatigue is a constant enemy.

This armor has been enchanted by Thalantyr of Beregost to further protect its wearer.
